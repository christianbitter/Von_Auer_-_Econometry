# this topic is concerned with taking a random simulation
# and demonstrating bias and efficiency in an estimator
# we generate a random sample of some normals
# we create the following types of estimators

# emperical mean, as the best estimator of the normals mu
# something biased
# something non-biased but with high variance
# and something where we might prefer the one with slight bias with lower variance
