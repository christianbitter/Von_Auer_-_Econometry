# Von_Auer_-_Econometry
This repository is a series of R scripts to help with understanding concepts and methods explained in the Springer Book "Ã–konometrie" by "von Auer". As such, you will find examples of data analysis, my own take on concepts explained and some attempts at modelling provided data sets. 

If you have suggestions, etc. please step up.
